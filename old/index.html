    <h3>Project Focus</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project is to design a practical device that can be used in emergency medical situations to act as a synthetic scab that can safely minimize the risk of excessive blood loss or infection due to a significant wound.
    </p>
    <h3>Project Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Wounds that are sustained in circumstances with limited medical equipment, where traditional bandaging is unavailable or insufficient, carry the significant risk of death or permanent injury due to excessive blood loss or infection.<br>
      The device that is being designed addresses this issue by accelerating the natural clotting process by creating a synthetic wound utilizing the Universal Platelet AB+ to prevent further blood loss and exposure.
