						<b>Task One: Provide a forecast of what the workforce demand would be over a five-year period to produce and market your team's technical application or process. Include the impact such production would have on the marketplace.</b>
						<br>After successful trials, experimentation and clearing with the Food and Drug Administration, our product would be able to be acquired by anyone with who may deem it a necessary precaution, similar to a fire extinguisher in every home.  Although the initial market share would be relatively small, as the purchase is nonessential and a product to supplement safety, the universal need for effective first aid would indicate a vast potential market share. Although expensive, people are very willing to spend money on devices designed to keep themselves safe.  I feel the potential for not only military, but primarily civilian use would provide more than enough investors and public interest to get the product off the ground rather quickly. As the technology is rather well known, it should be relatively easy to design and develop the product with a concerted and concentrated effort by a team of researchers and developers. Marketing would be necessary, as news coverage of the product would likely allow it to be well known rather quickly, and HG-10  may come to replace traditional first aid training given a period of experimentation and education to the public.

						<b>Task Two: Give two examples of undergraduate or graduate degree programs in science or engineering that directly relate to your team's NCT technical application. For each program, be sure to include the following:<br>
For each program, be sure to include the following: the URL address of the institution, the department (for example, chemical engineering, electronic engineering) where the program is offered, and a brief description of the program of study.</b>
<br>Cornell University offers a Master's degree program in Biomedical Engineering. Their page can be found at  <a href="https://www.bme.cornell.edu/bme">https://www.bme.cornell.edu/bme</a>. The department itself is the department of Biomedical Engineering, which is rather straightforward. The program aims to educate people as to how the body interacts at a cellular level with actions and reactions within the body. Using analytic processes they aim to create new systems capable of creating new therapeutic strategies, devices and diagnostics for health and medical care. This understanding would be essential to how our product could aid those in dire circumstances both in the short and long term, and how to optimize the product at a nearly molecular level. <br>
Duke University offers an undergraduate Biomedical Engineering programs as well, the homepage being located at <a href="https://bme.duke.edu/undergrad">https://bme.duke.edu/undergrad</a>. Similarly to the Cornell programs, and many other biomedical programs, they have their own department, called the biomedical department. This programs hopes to advance careers in the related area of study, academia and medicine, utilize their tech and knowledge to advance the state of technology to improve the human condition and health care, and finally they hope to analyze the social implications and effects of their work.

				<b>Task Three: Develop an idea for a new science and/or engineering degree program that might emerge given the advancements in scientific knowledge that the team has identified. Provide a title and 100-word description of this new degree program.</b>
				<br>A new science or engineering degree program that would emerge based off of our research would be called "Specialty Biomedical Engineering," a program where students would learn about one specific area of the body more in depth, rather than them learning about the whole body. This would help the students in the program develop products and ideas that would help solve for said part of the body. For example, if one class was focused on the lungs, they would be more apt to solve its problems than students that were taught a broader range of information.
